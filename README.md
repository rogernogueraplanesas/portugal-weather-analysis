# Portugal Weather Analysis
Wind Roses per municipality for Historical Hourly Wind Records of Mainland Portugal, Azores, and Madeira (2018â€“2023)


## Objective Summary
For this project, multiple files in **JSON** format (1.42 GB) containing climate data from different weather stations in Portugal (Mainland and Islands) were cleaned, formatted, and transformed into **CSV** files in order to create proper wind roses per municipality on a yearly, monthly, and yearly + monthly basis.

QGIS takes part in several steps, such as providing complementary data in function of the geolocation of each weather station as well as creating the final Atlas maps from the resulting wind roses.
